onPlay
 - call animation it takes id, headCanvas and bodyCanvas
 if the interval doesn't exist it set it up and calls the cropImage function for both canvases
 on pause : don't stop the interval but do call clearRect and change the frame-bg to the high res version
 on play: call cropImage and remove frame-bg high res version
 on stop: call clearRect and replace frame-bg with singer.png and set interval = undefined


// To find out why the animation is slow
run the function  separated from all other functions and check it's speed
If it's still slow figure whatever is causing it out
 - Check cropImage function
